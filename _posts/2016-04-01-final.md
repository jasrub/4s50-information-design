### The Data
The data I'm using is videos and their metadata from [Superglue](http://www.pubpub.org/pub/super-glue)

>Superglue is a core news research initiative that is a “digestion system” and metadata generator for mass media. An evolving set of analysis modules annotate 14 DirecTV live news broadcast channels as well as web pages and tweets. The video is archived and synchronized with the analysis. Currently, the system provides named-entity extraction, audio expression markers, face detectors, scene/edit point locators, excitement trackers, and thumbnail summarization. We use this to organize material for presentation, analysis, and summarization. Superglue supports other news-related experiments.


I'm currently a Research Assistant at the Viral Communications group at the Media Lab, and so, I have access to Superglue's source code.  
It has a web API that I could manipulate and add functions to as needed.

## Phase 1 - Data Exploration

### Sketches

### Code

The primary visual element I'm using are entities. Entities are word extracted from the closed captions using NLP engines.

Top entities, text size mapped to number of mentions

I used the [MediaCloud API](http://mediacloud.org/api/) and to cross reference the 2 data sources in order to find connections.
I draw a matrix but it doesn't make much sense:

{: .center}
![sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/code2.jpg){: .weather-image }
![sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/code3.jpg){: .weather-image }

I then moved to using just Superglue data.   
A square is colored if 2 entities were mentioned in the same sentence in the closed captions.  
The different gray shades represent the number of mentions together (connection strength).

![sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/code5.jpg){: .weather-image }
![sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/code6.jpg){: .weather-image }

Showing just half the matrix and highlighting on hover:

### Code

Plotting the entities and connections as a connected graph.  
The locations of the entities are determined by running SVD on the adjacency matrix.    
Text size represent number of mentions.

I have an issue with overlapping circles which is complicated to solve in p5.js.

My solution for it resulted in a weired scattering of the circles on the screen
(Lines on the following sketches appear on hover)

I tried using d3.js circle packing algorithm

I added interactivity.  
Selecting a circle animates it to the center and shows only connected circles around it.  
clicking on one of the circles around will start playing a video mentioning the 2 entities.

## phase 3 - Refinement

In the refinement phase, I explored different colors, shapes and transitions, trying to find the best way to communicate the news visualization.

Removing colors, working by the grid, and selecting fonts.  
Circles are highlighted on hover and represent connected entities.

Trying to change the circles to different shapes

![sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/end2.jpg){: .image-border }

![sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/end1.jpg){: .image-border }

In this phase I also changed the transitions to be based on [toxiclibs.js](http://haptic-data.com/toxiclibsjs) springs.  
The location of each entity is set by the SVD result, but the springs prevent the entities from overlapping and make the animation more fun.

### More Refinements:
I changed the sides, from left to right.  
Added a mark for the video location, so it doesn't just appear.  
Selected circles are "magnetized" to the video, so it is clear that the video and the entities are related
Also added a loading animation, so the user knows to wait for a video.   
The colors of the circles encode the type of entities (Person, Organization, City, State, Sport, etc.).  



The interaction is explained on the top left corner, which also helps balancing the screen.  
There are thin lines showing what entities are connected.  
Connected entities are highlighted on hover.
