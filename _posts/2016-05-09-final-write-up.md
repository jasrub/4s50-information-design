title: Final Project Reflection
---

My starting point for the final project was the data.  
I had this great data source called [Superglue](http://www.pubpub.org/pub/super-glue), which is data scrapped from news videos and their closed captions, recorded every day from 14 different channels.

I had different ideas about what would be interesting to do with this data, to name a few:

 - revealing the stories behind all this metedata - Who is interesting right now? What are they saying about him/her? What are the most used words or colors? 

 - Looking for different signals for things that happened in the past and are related to boiling stories (for example the story about Apple and the FBI that got a lot of headlines in march 2016 but actually started in June 2015 when big group of tech companies wrote a letter to president Obama)

 - finding a way to navigate between this enormous archive of videos, without using a search box. Showing how things relate to each other, what is similar, what is the same story.

My final visualization shows, at a first glance, what are currently the most mentioned topics in the news.  
Diving in, it also tells the story, what topics are related and why they are related.
I also enables a new way of navigating a big collection of news videos, that otherwise would time a lot of time to watch and search.

As for future improvements, I'm interested in designing a mobile version as well. currently a lot of data is shown on the screen, and this requires a big screen, which is great for watching the news, but having a mobile version as well will contribute to the idea that the user does not have time to watch the whole news cast right now, instead, he is interested in a short glance at what is going on, and maybe a short video bit about a subject that is interesting for him. this is perfect for a short ride on the train or watching while waiting in line to see the doctor.

Another improvement would be adding the ability to scroll through time, and see what subject has become bigger or smaller, and what connections were created and when.
