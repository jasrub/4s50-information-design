title: Lab3 - Mapping Census Data

Assigned: Tuesday 3/1/16

From the [CitySDK](https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/) Modules I chose to look into the employment data.
This data includes the number of people employed in different occupation types, divided by gender.

## Data Exploration
I chose to work with the data about occupation types.
I thought this could have a few interesting aspect, since the data is divided to male and female I could make a comparison between the two for different occupation. I’m also interested in the different spread of occupations across different areas of the us , and the change across time of the different occupations.

In order to explore the data, I started with the pie-chart example.
I thought that if I draw a pie chart for each state with the division for occupation I’ll get some interesting story. unfortunately this was not the situation. most pie charts look exactly the same.

I also tried categorizing the occupations to 5 main colors, but the result was still pretty similar.

Categorizing did reveal some basic differences between some male and female occupations.
(male pie chart are the lower ones, and they are much more orange, while the top, female charts are very purple)

I then tried representing the data with some bar charts:

Some occupations are clearly much more "blue" or "pink" this becomes more visible when minimizing:

I then tried using icons to represent the different occupations
