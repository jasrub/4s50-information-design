title: Lab3 - Mapping Census Data

Assigned: Tuesday 3/1/16

From the [CitySDK](https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/) Modules I chose to look into the employment data.
This data includes the number of people employed in different occupations by gender.


## Data Exploration

I thought tha data about occupation types could have a few interesting aspects, I thought I could make a comparison between the males and females in different occupations. 
I was also interested in the different spread of occupations across different areas in the US , and the change across time of the different occupations popularity.

In order to explore the data, I started with the pie-chart example.  
I thought that if I draw a pie chart for each state with the division for occupation Iâ€™ll get an interesting story.  Unfortunately this was not the situation.  
most pie charts look exactly the same.

I also tried categorizing the occupations to 5 main colors, but the result was still pretty similar.

Categorizing did reveal some basic differences between male and female occupations.
(male pie chart are the lower ones, and they are much more orange, while the top, female charts are very purple)

Here is the same data represented with bar charts:

Some occupations are clearly much more "blue" or "pink".


This is another representation using icons for the occupations:
