### 2.1 Weather data
Assigned: Thursday 2/11/16  

> Building off the examples shown in class (2/11) the homework assignment is to design and code (at least) 2 representations of the weather using data from the Dark Sky forecast API. One representation should be literal and one abstract. The literal version should convey the weather in a more traditional graphic language, i.e. bar charts, line graphs, histograms, typography, and iconography. The second representation, similar to the Clock Iteration assignment, should use the weather in a more graphically abstract way while still attempting to connote the weather. The form can be experimental and is up to you to define the parameters. The size should be 375 x 667 (landscape or portrait) for both of them.  

### Version 1

### Literal Representation  

#### Sketches

#### Code 

I started with a trying simple representation for the cloud cover value: pie charts, colored icons and a color gradient
  
![sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/weather1/literal1.png){: .weather-image }

I wanted the top part of the screen to show the current weather.
Since the data has a field called “Icon” I used it to choose what icon to show for the current weather and for each day.
I also used the summary text for the current weather.
I’ve used icons from [The Noun Project](www.thenounproject.com) and edited them to fit my needs (for adding light and heavy rain, etc.)
I also chose different Icons for showing the values for visibility, cloud cover, humidity, wind speed and precipitations.
In each of these icons, the opacity represent the value.
The wind speed icon is rotated to the direction of the wind bearing. for precipitation -
Probability is the opacity of the icon, while the intensity and type are shown in the icon itself.

This came out very cluttered and was improved in the next iteration.

### Abstract Representation  

#### Sketches

#### Code 

The abstract representation was the second one I’ve worked on.
Since my literal representation was mostly Greyscale and had no movement in it, I wanted the abstract one to be colorful and kinetic.
My initial ideas included:
- a representation for only speciAic values - (animations of snowAlakes/rain according
to the precipitation probability intensity and type , animations of clouds and landscape according to the cloud cover and visibility, etc.)
- Filling up the screen with text, taken from the summary for each hour / day
- different representation with circles, changing color or diameter according to different values.
I decided to move on with the circles idea.
I started with modifying Leslie’s example of plotting the different hourly values to drawing circles with diameter size mapped to the sum value of each data array:

{: .center}
![sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/weather1/abstract1.png){: .weather-image }


I then added more circles, this time, one inside the other, when the outer circle represents the current hour and the most inner one represents the 48th hour from now. each circle color was determined by the temperature, humidity and visibility values for the current hour: (ran this with the saved weather forecast and the current one to see differences)

![sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/weather1/abstract3.png){: .weather-image }

Finally, inspired by the jumping balls clock I've made in the previous clocks assignment:
{: .center}
![sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/weather1/abstract4.png)

I modified the [Balls example](http://p5js.org/examples/examples/Mobile_Shake_Ball_Bounce.php) from the P5.js website to fit my needs. 
In my visualization, each day is represented by a circle.
The circle diameter is set by the humidity value of that day.
The circle ‘jump’ between the min and max temperature values of that day (compared to all values of the week).
The jumping speed is the wind speed.
The blue channel of the circle color is set by the precipitation probability, green by precipitation intensity and the red by visibility.
The opacity of each circle is the cloud cover in that day.

### Refinement
 
Assigned: Thursday 2/18/16

>For the second and final part of the weather assignment, pick one of the two directions you showed in class – or integrate the two – iterate and refine it based on the feedback from the critique.


I've decided to move on with my literal representation.
I worked on making it more spacious, and more interactive, adding the option to "zoom in" on each day to get more details.  
The color of each day's column encodes the temperature, so at a firs glance the user can get what days are going to be the hottest / coldest.

#### Final version

Clicking on a day zooms in into that day.   
Swiping left changes to next day and right to previous.  
Swipe up to go back to main view.
